V(D)J references in 10X
-----------------------

10X V(D)J has their own reference set, that you can download and examine with
your CellRanger license. This is a separate reference set from IMGT - they have their own
checks, which you can read about on their `here`_. They also only have one allele per gene.
10X has their own proprietary alignment algorithm, which is not benchmarked publicly.

10X describes their process for customizing VDJ references `here`_. This can be provided
as a V(D)J reference via their fetch-imgt and mkvdjref scripts. Here, we just describe how to re-annotate
which was the recommendation of `Irac et al (2024)`_. We recommend Immcantation - so follow
the setup described in :doc:`immcantation` to install Change-O.
