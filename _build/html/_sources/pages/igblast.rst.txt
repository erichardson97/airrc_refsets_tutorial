IgBLAST stand-alone
=======================================================

Introduction
------------

IgBLAST developers have made strides to include AIRR-C Reference Sets for users and you can easily specify this with the
dropdown button on the IgBLAST webserver. For further information about using IgBLAST, refer to their guide.

Installation
---------------------------------------------------------

Assuming you don't already have an IgBLAST installation, download IgBLAST and
set your $IGDATA variable so that IgBLAST knows where to find the internal_data directory. You can also
either move the executables to your $PATH, or tell the interpreter where to find the IgBLAST binaries:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/igblast/release/LATEST/ncbi-igblast-1.22.0-x64-linux.tar.gz
    tar -xvzf ncbi-igblast-1.22.0-x64-linux.tar.gz
    export IGDATA=${PWD}/ncbi-igblast-1.22.0
    export PATH=$PATH:$IGDATA/bin

To follow the remainder of the steps, you will also need to install receptor_utils.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install receptor_utils

Downloading the AIRR-C Reference Sets
---------------------------------------------------------

When you initially set up IgBLAST (if it wasn't just now!), you will have
downloaded particular germline databases for the program which you will have supplied
to IgBLAST via its -germline_db_V, -germline_db_J and -germline_db_D arguments. To
use AIRR-C Reference Sets, we need to download the AIRR-C versions of these BLAST databases.
The developers of IgBLAST kindly make these available via the ftp server - or you can build
your own.


.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir $IGDATA/databases
    wget https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/igblast/release/database/airr/airr_c_human.tar
    tar -f airr_c_human.tar -C $IGDATA/databases

If you look in your $IGDATA/databases directory, you should see the following:

.. image:: images/igblast_screenshot.png
    :width: 600


In addition to these databases, IgBLAST has its own data directory called "internal_data",
which you are warned not to touch except for making your own custom species directories, as
well as "optional_files". To use the AIRR-C Reference Sets with full IgBLAST capabilities (i.e.
CDR annotation), you will need to create two file types using the receptor_utils package.

These are:

1. .ndm file: the ndm file contains CDR1 + CDR2 coordinates for the V genes in your reference.
2. .aux file: the aux file contains CDR3 coordinates for the J genes in your reference.

You can supply the paths to these new files when you run IgBLAST as a standalone using the
"-custom_internal_data" and "-auxiliary_data" flags. Because you'll be supplying the path yourself,
put them where you'd like - in the example below we keep it in a neat AIRR-C directory and put the
resultant files in the internal_data and optional_file directories.

Creating the .ndm file
----------------------
The .ndm file contains the CDR/FWR annotations for the V gene database.
The best way to do this is using the AIRR-formatted JSON file retrieved by the OGRDB API.
Retrieve for all three loci, run receptor_utilâ€™s make_ndm executable, and combine into a single .ndm file.

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir airrc_sets

    curl https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/api/germline/set/Human/IGH_VDJ/published/airr_ex > airrc_sets/human_VDJ.json
    curl https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/api/germline/set/Human/IGKappa_VJ/published/airr_ex > airrc_sets/human_kappa.json
    curl https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/api/germline/set/Human/IGLambda_VJ/published/airr_ex > airrc_sets/human_lambda.json


    make_igblast_ndm airrc_sets/human_VDJ.json VH airrc_sets/human_vdj.ndm.imgt
    make_igblast_ndm airrc_sets/human_kappa.json VL airrc_sets/human_vkappa.ndm.imgt
    make_igblast_ndm airrc_sets/human_lambda.json VL airrc_sets/human_vlambda.ndm.imgt

    cat airrc_sets/human_vdj.ndm.imgt > airrc_sets/airrc_human.ndm.imgt
    cat airrc_sets/human_vkappa.ndm.imgt >> airrc_sets/airrc_human.ndm.imgt
    cat airrc_sets/human_vlambda.ndm.imgt >> airrc_sets/airrc_human.ndm.imgt

    mkdir $IGDATA/internal_data/airrc_human
    mv airrc_sets/airrc_human.ndm.imgt $IGDATA/internal_data/airrc_human

Creating the .aux file
----------------------

The .aux file tells IgBLAST where to find the CDR3 coordinates in the IGJ genes. Again, this file cannot be downloaded
currently from IgBLAST. To do so, we need to download and parse the FASTA files from OGRDB to create a unified IGJ FASTA
for all the IG loci. Download the FASTAs:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/api/germline/set/Human/IGH_VDJ/published/gapped_ex > airrc_sets/human_VDJ.fasta
    curl https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/api/germline/set/Human/IGKappa_VJ/published/gapped_ex >> airrc_sets/human_VDJ.fasta
    curl https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/api/germline/set/Human/IGLambda_VJ/published/gapped_ex >> airrc_sets/human_VDJ.fasta

Excuse the Python - a code example for filtering each gene:

.. code-block:: python

    import receptor_utils
    import os

    seqs = receptor_utils.simple_bio_seq.read_fasta(os.path.join('airrc_sets', 'human_VDJ.fasta'))
    for gene in ['V', 'D', 'J']:
        with open(f'airrc_sets/human_gl_{gene}.fasta', 'w') as k:
            [k.write(f'>{seq_id}\n' + seqs[seq_id] + '\n') for seq_id in seqs if seq_id[3] == gene]

Now, we run "annotate_j" which you installed as part of receptor_utils:

.. code-block:: bash

    annotate_j airrc_sets/human_gl_J.fasta $IGDATA/optional_file/airrc_human_gl.aux

You now have all the files IgBLAST needs: the BLAST databases, and the coordinate files (.ndm + .aux).

Testing
-------

Let's test our installation using test data courtesy of the Immcantation team.

.. code-block:: bash

    curl https://zenodo.org/records/10046916/files/input.fasta?download=1 > example_data.fasta
    head -n 51 example_data.fasta > example_data_mini.fasta

    igblastn -germline_db_V $IGDATA/databases/airr_c_human_ig.V \
            -germline_db_J $IGDATA/databases/airr_c_human_ig.J \
                -germline_db_D $IGDATA/databases/airr_c_human_igh.D \
                -custom_internal_data $IGDATA/internal_data/airrc_human/airrc_human.ndm.imgt \
        -query example_data_mini.fasta -auxiliary_data $IGDATA/optional_file/airrc_human_gl.aux \
            -show_translation -outfmt '7 std qseq sseq btop' > test_output.fmt7

And there you have it!
