Welcome to Using AIRR-C Reference Sets's documentation!
=======================================================

Introduction
------------

AIRR-C Reference Sets are the AIRR community endorsed human reference sets for the IGH, IGKappa and IGLambda loci.
Currently, IgBLAST supports our new reference sets. In this Tutorial, we describe how to modify your IgBLAST, MiXCR
and 10x Pipelines to use these new sets. Welcome to the future!
