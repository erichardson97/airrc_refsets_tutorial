Using the AIRR-C Reference Sets as standalone
=======================================================

Introduction
------------

It is increasingly obvious that gene polymorphisms in the IG and TR loci play an important role in shaping the adaptive immune response in disease and vaccination. We encourage AIRR-seq practitioners to think carefully about the reference databases of IG and TR genes that they use in their analyses. For IG analyses, the AIRR-C Reference Set has been curated via a reproducible process, and you can see details about the curation in the AIRR-formatted JSON files.
