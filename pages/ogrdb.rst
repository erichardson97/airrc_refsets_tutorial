OGRDB REST API
=======================================================

`OGRDB`_ is the home of the AIRR-C Reference Sets, both `human`_ and `murine`_, and
is the de facto reference for matters concerning the germline sets.

Germline sets can be accessed from both the OGRDB webserver and the `REST API`_.
The germline sets are versioned (each version is also hosted on Zenodo) for reproducibility.

Below is a graphical representation of OGRDB's REST API which is used in the following sections.
