A brief description of how to re-annotate
-----------------------------------------

10X V(D)J has their own reference set, that you can download and examine with
your CellRanger license. This is a separate reference set from IMGT - they have their own
checks for things like pseudogene status, which you can read about on their website `here`_.
Other things to note: their default reference includes one allele per gene, and they make
assignments based on their own proprietary alignment algorithm.

10X describes their process for customizing VDJ references `here`_ - you can for example use IMGT as a V(D)J reference
via their fetch-imgt and mkvdjref scripts. Here, we just describe how to re-annotate which was the recommendation of
`Irac et al (2024)`_. We recommend Immcantation - so follow the setup described in :doc:`immcantation` to install
Change-O and get the AIRR-C References set up. Immcantation has a 10X tutorial `provided here`_ and also you can use their pipeline
directly as described on this `page`_ accompanying `this script`_. To briefly summarize, these scripts involve
taking the appropriate contig FASTA file output by CellRanger, re-annotating with AssignGenes, and then passing the 10X
flag and original contig annotation CSV file to the MakeDb command to correct the original annotations.
